It validates the password based on specific security rules to ensure it's strong. If the password is valid, the user details are stored in a CSV format and printed. Otherwise, an exception is raised with the message "Your password is weak".



Password Strength Criteria:

Must contain at least one number.
Must include at least one uppercase and one lowercase character.
Must have at least one special symbol from this set: @$!%*#?&.
Must be 6 to 20 characters long.
Input format :

Name, mobile number, username, password (Everything as a String)

Output format :

If the password does not satisfy the given condition, the output prints"""
